# tdt4215-22

Here you can find the detailed description of the group project requirements for TDT4215 Recommender Systems.

Original project authors are Lemei Zhang and Peng Liu.

Explicit Matrix Factorization implementation is based on the [blog](https://www.ethanrosenthal.com/2016/01/09/explicit-matrix-factorization-sgd-als/) by Ethan Rosenthal.

Start by looking at the **project_description.ipynb**, and then you can also take a look at the .py scripts if you're interested.

Good luck!
